Website Project Description

1. Comparing Webshop Systems — A Guide for Beginners

2. Project Idea

Our website focuses on comparing different webshop systems.
We explain how well-known systems like Shopify, OpenCart, Prestashop, shopware,woocommerce, sylius and Magento work along with their strengths and weaknesses.

The website aims to provide a quick overview for anyone who wants to create their own online shop but doesn’t know which system best fits their needs.
